# WALLABY Public Data Releases

This repository provides information, tutorials and data access scripts for public releases of data from the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind Survey (WALLABY). WALLABY is the all-sky 21-cm HI survey conducted with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) in Western Australia. It will map a significant fraction of the southern sky with the aim to detect the HI emission from more than 200,000 galaxies in the nearby Universe out to a redshift of about 0.1.

Please see the data release page on the WALLABY website (https://wallaby-survey.org/data/) for more information about WALLABY data access.
